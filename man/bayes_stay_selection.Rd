\usage{
bayes_stay_selection(
  formula_stay = Stay ~ 1,
  random_effect = NULL,
  stay_data = stay_data,
  col_name_cens = "Cens",
  family = "lognormal",
  cores = 1,
  iter = 3000,
  warmup = NULL,
  chains = 3,
  thin = 1,
  all_comb = TRUE,
  target_species = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula_stay}{A model formula for staying time within a focal area. For example, \code{Stay ~ 1 + x1}.}

\item{random_effect}{A character string specifying the random effect on the parameter of the staying time model. For example, \code{random_effect = "Station"}.}

\item{stay_data}{A data frame returned by the \code{format_stay} function, containing the processed staying time data.}

\item{col_name_cens}{A string specifying the column name in \code{stay_data} that indicates whether the observation is censored (1) or not (0).}

\item{family}{A character string specifying the probability distribution of staying time. Choose from \code{"exponential"}, \code{"gamma"}, \code{"weibull"}, or \code{"lognormal"}.}

\item{cores}{The number of CPU cores to use for parallel computation. Default is 3.}

\item{iter}{The total number of MCMC iterations per chain. Default is 5000}

\item{warmup}{The number of warm-up (burn-in) iterations per chain. Default is 1000.}

\item{chains}{The number of MCMC chains. Default is 3.}

\item{thin}{The thinning interval for MCMC sampling. Default is 4 (no thinning).}

\item{all_comb}{A logical value indicating whether to compare models with all possible combinations of covariates. If \code{FALSE}, only the specified model in \code{formula_stay} is evaluated.}

\item{target_species}{A character string specifying the species of interest. Only a single species can be specified.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the WAIC values for each model and a Bayesian P-value for the best predictive model. All MCMC samples are also available ($mcmc_samples)
