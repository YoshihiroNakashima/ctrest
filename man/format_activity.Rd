\title{Prepare data for estimating the proportion of time an animal is active}
\usage{
format_activity(
  detection_data,
  col_name_station,
  col_name_species,
  col_name_datetime,
  target_species,
  indep_time = 30
)
}
\arguments{
\item{detection_data}{A data frame containing information for individual videos, including:
\itemize{
\item Camera station ID (character)
\item Capture datetime (character)
\item Species name (character)
\item Other columns (e.g., number of passes, staying time, censoring flag) are ignored by this function.
}}

\item{col_name_station}{A string specifying the column name that contains camera station IDs.}

\item{col_name_species}{A string specifying the column name that contains species names.}

\item{col_name_datetime}{A string specifying the column name that contains datetime information (character).
If time is missing (e.g., only "2022/03/01"), "00:00" is assumed.}

\item{target_species}{A character vector specifying the species name(s) for which the activity proportion is to be estimated.}

\item{indep_time}{A numeric value specifying the minimum time interval (in minutes) to consider two detections as independent. Default is 30.}
}
\value{
A data frame with three columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{Species} (character): Species name.
\item \code{Station} (character): Camera station ID.
\item \code{time} (numeric): Time of detection, scaled from 0 to 2Ï€ (radians) for circular activity analysis.
Only independent detections are included.
}
}
\description{
This function filters detection data to retain only independent detections
of the specified species and transforms detection time into a circular format
for use in activity modeling.
