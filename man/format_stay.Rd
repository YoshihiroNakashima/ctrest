\usage{
format_stay(
  detection_data,
  station_data,
  col_name_station = "Station",
  col_name_species = "Species",
  col_name_stay = "Stay",
  col_name_cens = "Cens"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{detection_data}{A data frame containing information for individual videos, with six columns:
\itemize{
\item Camera station ID (character)
\item Capture datetime (character, not used in this function)
\item Species name (character)
\item Number of passes through the focal area (numeric, not used in this function)
\item Staying time (seconds) within the focal area for each pass in a video (numeric)
\item Whether the observation of the pass was censored (1 = censored, 0 = observed)
}}

\item{station_data}{A data frame containing information for each camera station, with one row per station.
It must include at least the camera station IDs (character) and may contain additional columns such as
location coordinates, covariates, and other relevant information. Unlike \code{detection_data}, this data frame
lists all the camera stations that have been set up.}

\item{col_name_station}{A string specifying the column name containing station ID information.}

\item{col_name_species}{A string specifying the column name containing detected species names.}

\item{col_name_stay}{A string specifying the column name containing staying time.}

\item{col_name_cens}{A string specifying the column name indicating whether the observation is censored (1) or not (0).}
}
\value{
A data frame with staying time information for the specified species.
The returned data frame contains the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{Station} (character): Camera station ID where the detection occurred.
\item \code{Species} (character): Species name.
\item \code{Stay} (numeric): Staying time (in seconds) within the focal area for each pass.
\item \code{Cens} (numeric): Indicator of whether the observation was censored (1 = censored, 0 = observed).
Additionally, all columns from \code{station_data} are included, matched by \code{Station}.
If no matching \code{Station} is found in \code{station_data}, those values will be \code{NA}.
